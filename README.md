This repository contains Streamlit projects for visualizing image color channels (RGB) and applying different color maps using NumPy, PIL, and Matplotlib.

**Project Overview**
➤ practise_image.py – Loads an image from a URL and splits it into Red, Green, and Blue channels.
➤ practise_myimage.py – Similar to the above, with additional features like grayscale conversion and matplotlib colormaps for image analysis.

**Features**
➤ Load images from URLs
➤ Split and visualize R, G, B channels
➤ Convert images to grayscale
➤ Apply Matplotlib colormaps (hot, cool, turbo, etc.)
➤ Interactive Streamlit web UI

**Tech Stack**
